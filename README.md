# Dynamic Team Bio

## Assignment Description
Create a Team Bio page based on your partners for the Integrated Project. You’ll have some standard team copy on the page initially (written by you); provide a way to click and change content for each team member.

This is a small team assignment with designer and developer roles.

## Assignment Requirements
Design a bio page! Consider this a page in the context of a larger studio site - look at how “real” design / dev houses do this, and come up with your own style.
Only one team member’s information should be visible at a time; you’ll provide some way to click and view each member’s information on demand.
Create an array to hold bio information (text) for each team member. Each team member is responsible for populating this array with text - add your own! You’ll be retrieving this text on a click or other event, and putting it into a paragraph tag (or multiple tags) on the page.
You will also include a headline for the team member’s name that will change based on
whose info is currently active.
Include an image tag that switches its source based on the team member you’re viewing
(head shot or something similar).
## Additional Requirements
1. Include a written plan / path with your submission. Analyze the requirements
and provide the solution
2. The developer will create a project repo and a Readme.md document for the repo with
detailed information about the project
3. Create a design branch; the designer will push the web assets to this branch. The
designer is responsible for the HTML and CSS for the project.
4. Create a dev branch for each member; BOTH need to add bio information to the array.
5. Merge everything to the master branch and submit a link to the dropbox on FOL
